A [fragment forge](../processing/fragment_forge) can enhance the yield of ores. When ores are processed in a fragment forge, they are broken into clumps and small clumps.

Nine small clumps can be crafted into a clump. These clumps can then be processed in a [centrifuge](../processing/centrifuge) to convert them into dusts and small dusts, which can be smelted in a furnace.

You can place raw ores into a fragment forge, but for some ores, better results are achieved by mining them with a silk touch pickaxe and placing the ore blocks into the forge.

Both the fragment forge and the centrifuge can also produce secondary ores. For example, processing [nickel](../resources/nickel) will yield nickel and may also provide some [platinum](../resources/platinum).
