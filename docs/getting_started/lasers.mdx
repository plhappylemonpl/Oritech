Before advancing further, you'll need some [fluxite](../resources/fluxite). To obtain it, overload amethyst clusters using an [enderic laser](../interaction/enderic_laser).

Crafting an enderic laser builds on previous steps. It requires a combination of alloys, assembled components, and items like [enderic compound](../resources/enderic_compound) and carbon fiber strands, which are made using a [centrifuge](../processing/centrifuge) and [pulverizer](../processing/pulverizer).

With your newly crafted enderic laser, a [target designator](../tools/target_designator), and a [generator](../processing/generators), you're ready to produce some fluxite.

To acquire fluxite, mine amethyst clusters with the enderic laser. Use the target designator to aim the laser at an amethyst cluster. The budding amethysts will not be broken; instead, they will be energized, promoting faster growth of budding amethysts.
