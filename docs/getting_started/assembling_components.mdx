Build an [assembler](../processing/assembler).

An assembler can craft some things (like wires, coils, and motors) more efficiently than you can, and it can craft some things that you are not able to craft.

Build a [centrifuge](../processing/centrifuge).

A centrifuge will be needed to make process some resources and create
components that will be needed for further progress.

Both machines require energy in the form of redstone flux (RF/FE), and can be upgraded using addons.
