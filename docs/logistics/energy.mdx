Oritech uses **RF** to power all of its machines, utilizing the Reborn Energy API on fabric or FE on neoforge.
This ensures compatibility with all energy-using mods on fabric and neoforge.

There is only one cable tier available, capable of transferring up to **10k RF/t**. If that's not enough, there's also superconductors, capable of transferring **4M RF/t**

Generators will always output energy, and all other machines accept energy from all sides without outputting it again.
The cables themselves store up to **10k RF** at each machine connection if they can't output the energy.

To buffer and store energy, you can use energy storage blocks. They're available in two sizes and can be massively expanded using addons.
Energy storage blocks accept energy from all sides through a ðŸŸ¢ *green port* and can only output through the single ðŸ”´ *red port*. A redstone signal will disable all energy output.

Energy can also be transferred wireless using an enderic laser. See [enderic laser](../interaction/enderic_laser).
