Fluid pipes behave similarly to item pipes. However, they also have a small internal storage at each connection. Like item pipes, when set to extract, they will extract from all neighboring blocks. However, unlike item pipes, blocks can also push fluids into a pipe, which the pipe then moves to the next available fluid storage.

To store fluids, you can use a fluid tank. The small fluid tank stores up to *256* buckets of fluid. When broken, the small tank retains all of its content in the item NBT. A comparator output will reflect the tank's fill status. Stacked tanks will automatically let the fluid flow downward.
