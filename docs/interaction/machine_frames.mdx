The *[block placer](../interaction/block_placer)*, *[block destroyer](../interaction/block_destroyer)*, and *[fertilizer](../interaction/fertilizer)* all operate on a gantry built with machine frames. The machine frame designates the area in which the machines operate. It must be rectangular and empty inside.

The machines always target the blocks **below** the frame.

Any number of machines can operate on the same machine frame. To achieve this, simply place multiple machines on the frame. The machines will iterate through all blocks in the frame area.

All machines that operate on machine frames can use most addons.

The speed addon increases both the movement and operation speed of machines working in the frame.
