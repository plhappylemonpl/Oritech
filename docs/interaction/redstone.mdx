Some Oritech machines can directly interact with redstone, such as the portable tank and the portable energy storage.
The portable tank's content can be measured using a comparator, and the portable energy storages' output can be disabled with a redstone signal.
For all other blocks, a "Redstone Addon Controller" is required.

The redstone addon controller can be attached like any other addon and configured via the UI. When configured, the data can be read using a comparator.
The comparator signal is output from the addon, not the machine itself. The machine can also be disabled with a redstone signal to the addon.
