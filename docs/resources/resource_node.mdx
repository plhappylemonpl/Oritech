Resource nodes are found throughout the world, appearing in clusters just above the bedrock layer.
They contain all types of overworld ores and are typically covered by a small pocket of [crude oil](../resources/crude_oil).

Resource nodes can only be mined with a [bedrock extractor](../interaction/deepdrill).

On the surface, the location of a resource node cluster can be identified by the occurrence of an [ore boulder](../resources/ore_boulder).
The ore boulder also indicates the type of ores found in the cluster.
