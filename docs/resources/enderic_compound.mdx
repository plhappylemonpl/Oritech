Enderic Compound is a peculiar yet useful substance that can be obtained by crushing ender pearls in
a [pulverizer](../processing/pulverizer) or a [fragment forge](../processing/fragment_forge), or by processing sculk in a [centrifuge](../processing/centrifuge).

This compound can be utilized to create budding amethyst in an [assembler](../processing/assembler) or to duplicate ores using an [atomic forge](../processing/atomic_forge).
