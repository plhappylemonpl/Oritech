Platinum is a valuable resource that can be somewhat challenging to locate. Platinum ores are most commonly found while
mining near bedrock, but they can also be easily discovered in the End.

Additionally, platinum can be obtained by processing [nickel](../resources/nickel) in a [fragment forge](../processing/fragment_forge).
