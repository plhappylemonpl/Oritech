Ore boulders are found on the surface of the world. They are composed of deepslate and are rich in various ores.

Make sure to remember where you found them!

[Resource nodes](../resources/resource_node) can be located beneath ore boulders near bedrock, often covered by pockets of [crude oil](../resources/crude_oil) or water.

The ores visible in the ore boulder indicate which ores can be found in the resource node below.
