Steel is a fundamental alloy used to create wires, coils, motors, and plating, all of which are essential for building various machines.

Steel can be created in a crafting grid:

<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'iron_ingot',
        'iron_ingot',
        '',
        'coal',
        'coal',
        '',
        '',
        '',
        ''
    ]}
    result="oritech:steel_ingot"
    count={1}
/>

The [foundry](../processing/foundry) can produce more steel using less iron and coal.
