Electrum is a basic alloy used to create [generators](../processing/generators), [energy pipes](../logistics/energy), and various components, machines, and addons.

It is known for its high conductivity.

Electrum can be created in a crafting grid:

<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'gold_ingot',
        'gold_ingot',
        '',
        'redstone',
        'redstone',
        '',
        '',
        '',
        ''
    ]}
    result="oritech:electrum_ingot"
    count={1}
/>

The [foundry](../processing/foundry) can produce more electrum using fewer gold and redstone resources.
