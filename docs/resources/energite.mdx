Energite is an alloy composed of [nickel](../resources/nickel) and [fluxite](../resources/fluxite), which can only be produced in a [foundry](../processing/foundry).

It's so full of potential energy that you can feel a slight tingle when touching it.

This alloy is essential for crafting batteries, machine addons, and components used in various machines that generate or store energy.
