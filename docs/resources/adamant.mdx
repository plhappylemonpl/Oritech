Adamant is a basic alloy used to create the [assembler](../processing/assembler), [steam boiler addon](../processing/steam_engine), machine cores, and various components and tools.

It is a very hard, although brittle material that is partially see-through, making it ideal for optical devices and similar workloads.

Adamant can be created in a crafting grid:

<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'oritech:nickel_ingot',
        'oritech:nickel_ingot',
        '',
        'diamond',
        'diamond',
        '',
        '',
        '',
        ''
    ]}
    result="oritech:adamant_ingot"
    count={1}
/>

The [foundry](../processing/foundry) can produce more adamant using fewer diamonds and nickels.
