Raw silicon can be created by grinding nether quartz in a [pulverizer](../processing/pulverizer)
or a [fragment forge](../processing/fragment_forge) and mixing the quartz dust with sand.

Once you have raw silicon, smelt it to obtain silicon.
This material is essential for building [fluid pipes](../logistics/fluid_transport) and other fluid processing machines.
