When a mob or living entity dies, it releases a soul. If a block capable of collecting the soul is within range (16 blocks), the soul will be collected by that block. This is visually represented by a small soul flying towards the block.

The soul will always move towards the closest collecting block.

Souls can be collected by:
- An Arcane Catalyst
- A Spawner Controller
