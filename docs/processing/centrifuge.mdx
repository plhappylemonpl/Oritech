The centrifuge separates and transforms items. It can be used to extract ore dusts from ore clumps obtained
from a [fragment forge](../processing/fragment_forge), spin coal dust into carbon fiber strands, or,
with a [fluid addon](../processing/addons), process oil or wheat into plastic sheets.

When processing fluids, the fluid addon has to be added and initialized before the centrifuge can take in fluids.
Fluids can be pumped in and out directly from the centrifuge, and not the addon.
