All Oritech machines require energy to operate.

Depending on the side, machines have different item behaviours:
- The top side is item-input only.
- The sides can be used for both insertion and extraction.
- The bottom only allows for item extraction.

The items contained in a machine will always be dropped when the machine is destroyed, while the energy and fluids contained will be lost. Machines can be broken using a pickaxe; there's no need for a special wrench or anything similar.
