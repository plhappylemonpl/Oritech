<ModAsset location="oritech:basic_jetpack" /> It's time to take to the skies. Oritech offers different jetpacks variants. All of them can fly using either
energy or turbofuel. To fill them with energy, any energy storage or a charger can be used. To fill the internal turbofuel tank, a charger block is required.

When supplied with turbofuel, the flight of the jetpack will be much faster. Exo jetpack variants are faster than their basic counterparts. They will move faster upwards,
and also increase the forwards speed without having to go up aswell.

Jetpacks can't be turned on or off. They'll be active when the jump key is held.

Both basic and exo jetpacks have an elytra counterpart. In this case, the jetpack will only be active when the user is flying with the elytra, and the jetpack will provide an
upward boost, unlike using fireworks.
