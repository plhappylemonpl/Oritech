Hi, I need to convert some markdown files to mdx. Both are in custom formats. The input markdown includes a small json header. The result files should follow this schema:
---
title: Machine Basics
icon: oritech:assembler_block
---
CONTENT

All links used this format: [steel](^oritech:resources/steel)and should be remapped to this format: [steel](../resources/steel)

Also please correct any grammar issues and rewrite the content to be easy and good to read.
If you encounter a crafting recipe tag (e.g. like this: <recipe;oritech:crafting/assembler>), just replace it with TODO CRAFTING <recipename here>.

Please also convert image tags to this format: <ModAsset location="oritech:image_name" />

Also, tags like this: <block;oritech:crop_filter_addon> should be converted to images aswell

Please remove these sections: ;;;;;

Use markdown formatting where you think it fits.

I'll give you the input files in the next messages. Please only respond with the results, nothing else.
